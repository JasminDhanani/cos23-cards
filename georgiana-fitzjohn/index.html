            No, not really, but like the rest of the song goes 'I'd like to take a minute
            Just sit right there' and tell you how I came to enter content strategy.

            <b> Crafting the perfect story for end users is key in connecting with users. </b>
           </H3>
        
        
            I specialize in crafting user-centric stories.
            At Codeweavers I help solve content problems, for example, creating user guides and knowledge base articles, UX app writing.
            I'm going one step further- I'm currently getting my master's in Content Strategy. 
            Using storytelling techniques and a deep understanding of content strategy, I can help businesses connect with their target audience in meaningful ways.
